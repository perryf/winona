<!-- Really great job Sarah!  You app looks and functions really well.  Good job figuring out how to use an external API and for creating an app that feels professionally made-->
<!-- A few other ideas for improvement not listed in other parts of my comments: -->

<!-- * Make it so you can't add the same movie twice to your database -->
<!-- * Possibly make it more obvious how to add a movie to your list -->
<!-- * Following up on the last one - Icons look good but are pretty small and not entirely obvious what they do -->
